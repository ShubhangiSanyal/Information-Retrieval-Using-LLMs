So, one other strategy where you don't want to, I mean, one of the other disadvantages of doing this is that maybe that there are some minority anomalies in this data, and the choice of test data that you have made might have hidden all these anomalies, so you never see them, and maybe it's important to see them. So there may be many situations, or maybe you just don't have enough data as a whole to build a good model by only looking at 80%. So another strategy is to systematically do this with different subsets. So what you're really asking at some higher level is that machine learning approach. So, remember, we have seen only decision trees, but we are going to see many models. So there are clearly many ways to build models. And the reason, whenever you see that there are many ways to do something, it's only because there is no guarantee that a given way is the best one. So more or less what you want to validate is, I have, say, seven different strategies Relevance Score: 0.35 Document Rank: 2, Document Index: 6 Document: what you're really looking for is correlations between sets of items across transactions, which we formalize in terms of these association groups. X implies y. And what we saw is that as such, combinatorially, this is a very complicated thing to calculate, given the sizes of the sets involved. But we can use this appropriate principle both to identify the sets which are interesting, those which are frequent enough to be considered, and also to decompose them into rules. So you use the approoriate twice, once to find the frequent z, and second to decompose each frequent z into possible x implies y. And using this, we can build our first simple supervised learning model. So these rules now become a very simple way of prediction. Now, if you give me a document, I will look at what words are there in the document in this previous example. And if it contains the word student and school, I will predict education. If it contains game and team, I'll predict sports. Now, of course, if it has Relevance Score: 0.32 Document Rank: 3, Document Index: 8 Document: have to do a search through all possible trees. So instead we wanted to use some heuristic. So the main question that we have to ask is, which attribute do we query next at any stage. So our goal is to achieve this partition, which is pure, where all the values are yes or all the values are no. So we try to accelerate towards that. So that is this greedy strategy. So we use a heuristic, which will reduce the impurity as much as possible. And when we move from one node to its children by asking a question, what we do is we compute a weighted average. So for each node we can compute the impurity. But then when we combine the children of a node to get the impurity at the next level, we use a weighted average. So going simple weighted average just assigns a weight one to every item. So you just take the fraction. So for node one, you take the fraction of instances in that partition, multiply that fraction by the impurity and so on, and add it up, and we choose the one which reduces. So Relevance Score: 0.30\",\n          \"Document Rank: 1, Document Index: 9 Document: and is therefore picking up some peculiarities which don't necessarily exist within. So one of the things we mentioned in passing was that we like short trees for two reasons. One is because they are easier to explain. The second thing, which I claim without any justification, is that they generalize better. So here, priority, they are saying, let us not construct deep trees. So whatever tree we construct, we are going to stop it when it reaches. So it's a two step process, right? So what you do is you first say what are the parameters for the decision tree classifier? So he says, I want a decision tree classifier to be set up with this random state 42 and which will not grow to more than depth two. And then I have to actually construct the classifier for a particular data set. So that's the next thing. So I use this fit function, right? In some sense this creates a decision tree object with certain operating parameters, and then you pass it the training data in the form of the input Relevance Score: 0.99 Document Rank: 2, Document Index: 14 Document: and two, three are the petal. So it's taking all the rows and it's taking the third and fourth columns. So we're throwing away two columns. So we are making it, instead of a four column array, we are making it into a two column array. And in this data. So when you load the data set, it automatically produces these two subparts, iris data and iris target. So target is the classification variable. Remember, in this case, the classification variable is a three way thing, right? There are three types of irises that we saw, so it will be essentially a number, zero, one. And now to get this decision tree classifier, we have to take this function that we have imported. So we say take a decision tree classifier. We have to provide it with, again some random state because it uses some randomization inside it. And now this is something which we have not talked about. So we discussed that we will build a decision tree normally until we either achieve some pure leaf nodes where the classification Relevance Score: 0.98 Document Rank: 3, Document Index: 3 Document: So last time we started with supervised learning in earnest, and we were looking at this decision tree model. So, in a decision tree model, you have essentially a table in which the columns are the. So each item, a row in the table and one special column denotes the class that you are trying to classify. And we assumed it's a binary classification. So the class is zero, one, or yes, no, or whatever you want to interpret. The two categories are. So the algorithm was very simple. At a high level, what you want to do is choose an attribute based on the answer to the question that you're asking about that attribute. The data splits, and then you take each partition, ask another question. So that's the thing. And you want to come down and keep asking questions until either you have reached, like these situations here, a partition in which all the values of the class variable are the same. So you have a uniform class level or you have run out of questions, because we can only ask in any path Relevance Score: 0.94\",\n          \"Document Rank: 1, Document Index: 2 Document: whatever, income, stuff like that. So each row in the table will be one item, and there will be a special column which indicates what category, depending on the classification problem that we are dealing with, what category it is. And the goal of supervised learning is to now construct, given a new row, a new item, a new combination of these attributes, which is not seen before, try to predict what would be the most appropriate category to assign. So these items which are given with the labels. So these are called labels. So these items are called training data. So we have labeled training data, which consists of some information which has been collected in the past, some historical information about items and their classification. And we want to find a model that generalizes the training data. So since normally this categorization corresponds to some kind of classification, this is typically called a classification problem. So classification problem could be a binary problem. It Relevance Score: 0.99 Document Rank: 2, Document Index: 0 Document: a specification, but generating a concrete program from a generic program you can think of a model template as. So I just give you a line here which says a Y equal to Mx plus c. And here I want a specific m zero and C zero, which fits the given data in the best possible way, which is also part of the description of the algorithm. What does it mean for one line to be better than another line? So that's part of it. So the other side of this picture, as I mentioned, is when you don't have this training data, you don't have any examples that people have already labeled, but you are looking for some kind of patterns. So there is no guidance. So the thing about supervised learning is somebody should have gone through and given you this information before. Now, this information could have been collected over time. Maybe it's not manually collected, like the school marks. The school marks over time. Everybody has. I mean, the school keeps a record of what happens in the model exams, what Relevance Score: 0.90 Document Rank: 3, Document Index: 5 Document: the data. So what we are trying to do is learn some kind of mathematical models from data. And this falls into two broad categories. So the first category is where you are given examples. So you are told, for instance, this is, for example, supposing you're trying to evaluate whether a painting is painted by a particular type of. So there are these pools of painting, like impressionists and cubists and so on. So you might be given a lot of pictures saying, this is cubist, this is not cubist, this is impressionist, and so on. And then from these examples which are given to you with manual information, you are supposed to build a model which will take an unknown painting and tell you from its features which of these categories. So this is a typical supervised learning kind of thing. Unsupervised learning is something which is closer to the data mining situation where you have data and you are looking for patterns, but you don't really have a clear idea beforehand what patterns they are.

I mean, there are any number of situations where people type their email address wrong and so notifications don't reach them and so on. So there is this data collection. How do you collect the data and how do you clean it? And the third thing is, how do you make it uniform? So when data is being collected by different people, they may collect different things.

You might, for example, if it is, say, some medical diagnosis, then you may not be very concerned about the date of birth. I mean the year of birth, yes, but you may not need to know whether it's January 27 or May 30. It may not make much difference. So there are some things which may be less or more relevant, or even place of birth may not be so relevant, and so on. So you might automatically throw out some. But in general, we don't know. So in general, we are running all these things. So the algorithm works just looking at the values without asking what does a one mean and what does a five mean. So this is something to keep in mind. So our strategy is to maximize the reduction in the impurity. And this terminology comes from that entropy interpretation. So in entropy information theory, entropy is loss of information. If you have more entropy, you have less information. If you have more information, your entropy reduces. Right. I discussed that if you know the message for certain, you have full information about what the message contains in advance. You don't even need to send the contents, you just need to say there is a message, like a missed call, and you would know what the message means. So, information is entropy going down is the same as information going up. So this is sometimes called maximizing. Reduction in entropy is sometimes also referred to as maximizing the information gain. But because this is an uninterpreted kind of algorithm, that is, we are just looking at the attributes and comparing the information gain without asking what the attributes really signify, we are just taking the one that works best. So the problem is that there could be some attributes which give information gain but have no significance. And a typical example of this is something which is like a serial number, right? So imagine that you have something like Aadhaar number or passport number, or in a class, you have distinct roll numbers. Every student has a Document: When I write in canonical order, it has one fixed order, I one to ik. So if I drop ik, I get one set of size, k minus one. If I drop I k minus one, the second last element, I get a different subset, and if I merge those two, I get back this set. So if I have this set which y which is supposed to be in Ck, then it will actually be got by merging back these two subsets of y. So for every y that should be in Ck, it's going to be in Ck prime. Now I'm also going to get things in Ck prime which are not in Ck because they merge correctly. But there may be some other k minus one subset which is not frequent and which I'm not checking. So there will be some spurious entries in Ck prime, some things which should not be frequent because there is actually a known k minus one set which is not frequent. But I don't bother. I just am interested in saying that Ck prime is good enough for me. So the main advantage of this is that it's relatively speaking, given that our assumption is at every level, this fks are small. This is much faster than going to the bigger set and then filtering down, building up the bigger set from the smaller set. Even if we over approximate is going to be much faster and it's not going to be too much, because we know that the smaller sets are actually quite small. So, so the, if you want to think about how to do this algorithmically. So what we have is we have our set f k minus one. So supposing we just sort it in dictionary order, right? We think of these as k minus one tuples, and we sort it in dictionary order. Meaning that if the first position where two entries differ, if one is smaller than the other one, then that tuple is smaller. The first letter in the word which differs is smaller. So that's a dictionary. So what I will have is I will have a bunch of things where I have the same I one, two, I k minus one, and then I have a different j one. Jk, jk. So I will have a block of things at the beginning of my sorted order, where the first k minus one Document: I'm not going to formalize this anymore, but it's very similar in idea to the prior year. So you can formalize this algorithm for yourself, but it's essentially saying the same thing, except here the thing is constraint, because we know that z is fixed. So once z is fixed, then we just have to start with each individual element in z as a possible right hand side, and then work forwards to that. We don't have to look at all. So for each z, we do this calculation within that set. So that's how you generate association rules once you have a frequent set. So within that set, you play this a priority game with respect to the size of the right hand side, and then you generate all the rules. Is this clear? Yes. So it's exactly the same as the previous one, just a slightly different presentation of the idea. Okay, so now, as I said, this whole thing so far has been largely a kind of algorithmic problem, right? In some sense, if I fix the set of items and the set of transactions and the set of the two thresholds, the support and the confidence threshold, then for any x, comma y, either it is true or it is not true. So there is a fixed answer. So the answer is known. So this is something where I can actually validate that you have either enumerated all the association rules or you have missed out something. So technically there is no learning involved. It's more an algorithmic question. So how does one connect this to learning? Well, in specific context, you can interpret these rules as classification rules. So, remember we said supervised learning says, if this is there, then it is a fraud. If this thing is not there, then it is not a fraud, and so on. So, let's look at a typical example. So, supposing we have some question which is about labeling the topic of a document. So our items now are words, and our baskets are collections of words, sets of words. So for each document, we have one word which describes its topic. So here is an example. On the right. So the topic\",\n          \"Document: build a decision tree normally until we either achieve some pure leaf nodes where the classification is uniform, or we run out of attributes. Now this is a numerical case, so we are not going to run out of attributes because we are going to run out eventually when we run out of data points. But we will end up with these very long slicing, the width between 1.5 and 1.71.5 and 1.6 and so on. So what you can do is you can tell the decision C classifier not to expand beyond a certain depth. And here it has fixed it to be depth too. So we will come back to this at a later lecture, which is, this is related to this generalization question. That is, if you build a very detailed tree that asks a lot of questions, then you start asking questions which are very specific to the training data and you end up with what is called an overfitted model, a model which is following your training data too closely and is therefore picking up some peculiarities which don't necessarily exist within. So one of the things we mentioned in passing was that we like short trees for two reasons. One is because they are easier to explain. The second thing, which I claim without any justification, is that they generalize better. So here, priority, they are saying, let us not construct deep trees. So whatever tree we construct, we are going to stop it when it reaches. So it's a two step process, right? So what you do is you first say what are the parameters for the decision tree classifier? So he says, I want a decision tree classifier to be set up with this random state 42 and which will not grow to more than depth two. And then I have to actually construct the classifier for a particular data set. So that's the next thing. So I use this fit function, right? In some sense this creates a decision tree object with certain operating parameters, and then you pass it the training data in the form of the input and the output x and y, and say fit. So the important thing to see is that this is all you Document: so now this is the real part. So, so Scikitlearn has some built in data sets and one of them is this iris library. So the way to get the iris library into your data set is to import this function called load iris. And Scikitlearn has a bunch of models predefined. So what we have been looking at is decision trees as classifiers. So we are going to import from the subset of models of form tree. We are going to import this model called decision tree classifier. So the first thing that we do is we actually load this data set. So we call this load iris function, and then we are going to remember, the iris data set had two measures. It had the petal and the sepal, length and width. So it had four quantities. But we decided we will only use two quantities. So this is what this is doing. It's taking this iris data set and it is looking at essentially columns, indices. Two and three are the siple and two, three are the petal. So it's taking all the rows and it's taking the third and fourth columns. So we're throwing away two columns. So we are making it, instead of a four column array, we are making it into a two column array. And in this data. So when you load the data set, it automatically produces these two subparts, iris data and iris target. So target is the classification variable. Remember, in this case, the classification variable is a three way thing, right? There are three types of irises that we saw, so it will be essentially a number, zero, one. And now to get this decision tree classifier, we have to take this function that we have imported. So we say take a decision tree classifier. We have to provide it with, again some random state because it uses some randomization inside it. And now this is something which we have not talked about. So we discussed that we will build a decision tree normally until we either achieve some pure leaf nodes where the classification is uniform, or we run out of attributes. Now this is a numerical case, so we are not going to run Document: So last time we started with supervised learning in earnest, and we were looking at this decision tree model. So, in a decision tree model, you have essentially a table in which the columns are the. So each item, a row in the table and one special column denotes the class that you are trying to classify. And we assumed it's a binary classification. So the class is zero, one, or yes, no, or whatever you want to interpret. The two categories are. So the algorithm was very simple. At a high level, what you want to do is choose an attribute based on the answer to the question that you're asking about that attribute. The data splits, and then you take each partition, ask another question. So that's the thing. And you want to come down and keep asking questions until either you have reached, like these situations here, a partition in which all the values of the class variable are the same. So you have a uniform class level or you have run out of questions, because we can only ask in any path one question per attribute. And if in case we have the second case where we run out of questions, but we have not reached a so called uniform node, then we just use the majority as a prediction. So we will see an example of this later as we go. Yeah, so what we also said was that, as we can see here, we have two different trees, and the trees are not the same shape. And we argued that a smaller tree is probably a more desirable one. It's more explainable. And we also claim, without at the moment justifying, that it also has a better generalization property. That is, it will move from the specific training data to the unknown data in a better way. So how do we build small trees? Well, computationally, we said, I claimed at least that it was infeasible to build the smallest tree. So you would have to do a search through all possible trees. So instead we wanted to use some heuristic. So the main question that we have to ask is, which attribute do we query next at any stage. So our goal\",\n          \"Document: So we were looking at this market basket analysis, and towards the end of the discussion on association rule rules, if everybody who buys X is also likely to buy y. We said that one application of this association rule idea is to have these so called class association rules. So the right hand side was a category. We looked at an example with documents and we said, if a document has these words, it is also likely to belong to this category. So that brings us to the topic that is one of the central ones in machine learning, which is the idea of supervised learning. So in supervised learning, we have a set of items, and each item belongs to some category or class, and we distinguish these items in terms of some attributes. So you can think about this, as we will see shortly, you can think about these attributes as columns, right? So the attributes will be things like name, age, date of birth, whatever, income, stuff like that. So each row in the table will be one item, and there will be a special column which indicates what category, depending on the classification problem that we are dealing with, what category it is. And the goal of supervised learning is to now construct, given a new row, a new item, a new combination of these attributes, which is not seen before, try to predict what would be the most appropriate category to assign. So these items which are given with the labels. So these are called labels. So these items are called training data. So we have labeled training data, which consists of some information which has been collected in the past, some historical information about items and their classification. And we want to find a model that generalizes the training data. So since normally this categorization corresponds to some kind of classification, this is typically called a classification problem. So classification problem could be a binary problem. It could be, yes. No. This mail is junk. This mail is not junk. It could also be multi way, especially Document: and make the best line out of it. So it's not quite generating a program from a specification, but generating a concrete program from a generic program you can think of a model template as. So I just give you a line here which says a Y equal to Mx plus c. And here I want a specific m zero and C zero, which fits the given data in the best possible way, which is also part of the description of the algorithm. What does it mean for one line to be better than another line? So that's part of it. So the other side of this picture, as I mentioned, is when you don't have this training data, you don't have any examples that people have already labeled, but you are looking for some kind of patterns. So there is no guidance. So the thing about supervised learning is somebody should have gone through and given you this information before. Now, this information could have been collected over time. Maybe it's not manually collected, like the school marks. The school marks over time. Everybody has. I mean, the school keeps a record of what happens in the model exams, what happens in the board exam. So it comes automatically. The bank will be keeping records of all the loans that it bought and what happened to the customers who bought loans. So this historical information is accumulated over time. On the other hand, in some situations, like the example I mentioned about classifying paintings, now, when you go into a museum or you go into some art gallery or something, the painting doesn't have a label on it, saying, this is a painting of this type and this is a painting of that type. So somebody, if you want to fit this training model to it, somebody has to sit and actually label these things for the algorithm. So there is a lot of work in it. So generating a lot of valid training data is itself a kind of computationally intensive task. How do you provide a lot of well trained examples? Because the assumption is that the labels that these training samples have are somehow correct Document: to the way the data is available. So what we are going to be doing is agnostic to the domain. So we are not going to believe anything or assume anything about the domain, except that we will want to validate at the end somehow that what we are doing is right. But in practice what you're saying makes sense that really to do supervised learning, it's much more realistic to do it in collaboration with somebody who understands a domain rather than just doing it blindly. Because also when you do it blindly, you might come up with solutions which make no sense. You might actually identify features which contribute to a decision purely by statistical coincidence, and no human would actually do that. So there's another issue which comes up of interpretability or explainability of your answers. So there are various factors which get into this. It's only not only accuracy which matters, but also whether your model is sensible in something, so that you can justify it. So these will all come as we go along. So let's proceed with this. So the first thing is that because the choice of attribute to question will determine the structure of the tree. So here are two different trees. So this is the tree we started with, and in a sense this tree, if you remember that table, consists of asking the first column first. So the first column in our table was age. So we asked age, and then maybe we adapted our question based on age, whereas here we have directly jumped to own a house. The question to ask is which of these trees intuitively is better secondary? What is the definition of better over here, a shorter tree or a tree which predicts better? So here both trees are predicting. Exactly. So there is no mistake, at least with respect to the training data. Of course we have not seen what it does with the unknown data, but if you are just looking at its behavior on the training data, all of these things reach nodes in which I don't have any confusion, any majority to choose.
