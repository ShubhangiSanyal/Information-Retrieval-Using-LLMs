This folder contains all the notebooks used for pre-processing the datasets.<br>

We started with resume dataset:
  - `preprocess.ipynb`
  - `preprocessed_dataset`<br>

We then moved on to transcripts generated from CMI lecture videos:
  - 'transcripts'
  - `QnA` -> containing all the queries and ground truths
